Reading Tips
============

- functions are defined from the most concrete to the most abstract (i.e. functions that are dependended on are defined
  earlier/higher in the file.  This is possibly exactly reverse of what you might be used to.  The trick is to read
  the file from the bottom, up.
  - I did this because I want to use JSHint's "latedef" option to catch nasty bugs caused by hoisting.
