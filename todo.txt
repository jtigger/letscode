WeeWikiPaint

Minimum Marketable Feature:
- single-user painting on home page
- collaborative painting page (very basic)
- wikify pages
- more complex painting
- more collaborative features
- collaborative painting wiki

User Stories:
[ ] "Draw a Line" (via touch)
[ ] "Draw multiple lines"
[ ] "Abort line-draw" (when user hits Esc)


Future Ideas:
[ ] split the dependencies into "build", "test", and "production" groups (possible?)
[ ] add an assembly step in the build to merge all code into a single package-able/deployable web app.
    (mostly, this is about being able to keep source files in whatever organization I want, but then be able
     to move stuff around for an actual deployment, like jquery).
[ ] set time limits for tests.
