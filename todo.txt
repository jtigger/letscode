User Stories:
[ ] "Canvas"
    As a WeeWikiPaint author
    I want to see a drawing canvas
    so that I know where I can paint.
    [ ] setup client-side testing
    [ ]

[ ] "Draw a Line"


Future Ideas:
- abstract away the test framework (?!?!?)
  - swap out for a different test framework to make sure the abstraction layer works.
